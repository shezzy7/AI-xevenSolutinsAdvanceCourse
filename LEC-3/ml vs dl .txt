Machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence.In machine learning we does not provide any rule to  model for making decisions.We give some data and some results that can be generated from this data.We use labeled(supervised learning) data for training machine learning algorithm.Our model learns the reltions between several outputs based on given inputs and makes rule by itself.
But there comes a problem with machine learning algorithms which is that machine learning algorithms cannot accept unstructured data like images,voices,text etc as an input for processing and also there learning power from data is less.

Deep learning
So to overcome this problem a sub-domain of ml was introduced with the name of neural networks.Later to make a enhancement in this field this name was changed to 'Deep learning'.In deep learning we do study of neural netwroks.Basically in neural networks we build and connect a large number of functions to which we name an artificial neuron and after connecting these neurons the resultant network is known as a neural network(deep learning).These networks of artificial neurons need high computation power to work as compared to ml algos.They also need a large amount of data for training.
